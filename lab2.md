### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Licensing provides the possiblity of improved software and the creation of a development community. It allows user to study, modify, and freely distribute your code.

### Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
Without a license there can be legal ramifications. You could be fined for improper use of a company's software. 

### After reading the section of Why the Web beat Gopher, do you agree with the claim?
I do agree that Gopher did fail by not following the open systems model. It is a good example of the benefits of open source. Gopher could have progressed quickly with the creation of a development community and feedback from users.

### Can you justify such a license?
