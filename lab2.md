### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Licensing provides the possiblity of improved software and the creation of a development community. It allows user to study, modify, and freely distribute your code.

### Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
Without a license there can be legal ramifications. You could be fined for improper use of a company's software. 

### After reading the section of Why the Web beat Gopher, do you agree with the claim?
I do agree that Gopher did fail by not following the open systems model. It is a good example of the benefits of open source. Gopher could have progressed quickly with the creation of a development community and feedback from users.

### Can you justify such a license?
The MIT License provides many benefits to the software producer and user. These include no limitations on rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, or distribute software.

### Which is the best license?
It seems the Apache/BSD license provides the most benefits for a developer. Unlike the others it provides private use. This allows the developer to make modifications to the software without having to release it to the public. LGPL seems to be the best license for the common good. Despite it's lack of sublicensing, the amount of freedom the license provides allows for derivative works to be easily created and distributed. GPL seems to be the best for companies. Copies can be made of the software, but they are automatically tied to the GPL license, making it easier for changes made to the software to be tracked.
